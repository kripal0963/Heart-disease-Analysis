# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis and Visualization with Python
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of heart disease data using Python. It walks through various statistical and graphical techniques to understand the patterns in the dataset and gain insights that can help predict heart disease risk.

📊 Project Objectives
Perform univariate and multivariate analysis.

Visualize patterns using plots like histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and heatmaps.

Identify relationships between features related to heart disease.

Detect outliers and understand the data distribution.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python 3

Pandas – for data manipulation

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualizations

Jupyter Notebook – for interactive analysis

🔍 Key Analyses Performed

✅ Univariate Analysis
Summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)

Histograms and boxplots to detect outliers and distributions

✅ Multivariate Analysis
Correlation heatmaps

Scatterplots and pair plots

Cross-tabulations

✅ Visualization Highlights
Countplots to show distribution of categorical features (e.g., chest pain type)

Heatmap to explore correlations between numerical variables

Side-by-side boxplots for comparing features by target variable
